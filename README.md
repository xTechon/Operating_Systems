Programing Assignments for my Operating Systems Class

---

`PAssign1` contains two problems:<br>
Problem 1: Multithreaded Java Consumer and Producer application<br>
Problem 2: Very basic Dos to Linux command line interpreter writen in C<br>
<br>
`PAssign2` is a Banker's Algorithm Deadlock tester written in C++<br>
<p>
The project uses the Eigen Matrix header library and the fmt library for output.<br>
std::format is part of the C++20 standard but only was only implemented by
MS Visual Studio when the project was created,
so the `{fmt}` library was included to add the functionality
